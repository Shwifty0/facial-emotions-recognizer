# facial-emotions-recognizer
This is a personal project, where I used my PyTorch (Deep Learning) framework skills and created a DL app that recognizes facial emotions using the ResNet18 layer model.
Since the datasamples were only 152, I used data augmentation to make the learning harder for the model and not overfit on the training data.
